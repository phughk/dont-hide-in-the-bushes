# Don't hide in the bushes

This is a single and multiplayer text-based RPG.
The idea is that the gameplay should be quite similar to [Sanctuary RPG](https://sanctuaryrpg.com/).

The themes of the game are varied and off-beat, giving a immersive table-like feel for a role playing game.

The game graphics engine is made with [Termloop](https://github.com/JoelOtter/termloop).

The networking is written using peer-to-peer over UPnP via [goupnp](https://github.com/huin/goupnp).
